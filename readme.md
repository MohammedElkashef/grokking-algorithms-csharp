## Grokking Algorithms in C#

### Overview

Welcome to the **Grokking Algorithms in C#** repository! This project is a collection of algorithms implemented in C#, inspired by the book *Grokking Algorithms* by Aditya Bhargava. The goal of this repository is to provide clear, well-documented implementations of fundamental algorithms, making it easier for developers to understand and apply them in their own projects.

### Contents

This repository includes implementations of various algorithms covered in the book, including:

- **Binary Search**
